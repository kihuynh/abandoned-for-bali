## Abandoned for Bali!
#### Ruby on Rails, 5-4-2018

## Description
Taking a pre-existing project that has been abandoned by a developer who jumped ship to go to Bali! Leaving a horrible project, and horrible documentation. It's my duty to add AJAX and refactor what I can. Maybe after this I might leave for Bali myself as well.

## Current AJAX capabilities
- TBA
## Future AJAX
- As user add items to the shopping cart, the shopping cart on navbar will update along with the cart.
- Users can hide and show product details
- Users can remove item in their shopping cart without having the page to reload

### Previous documentation
Here is the lovely documentation that the previous developer left before leaving forever to Bali.
```
E-commerce site. Uses `bcrypt` and `materialize`. There's a seed file. Set up your own admin. If you have questions, I'll be in Bali with no email. Ask someone else.

To set up:

* `rake db:setup`

* Sorry, didn't get around to tests. It mostly works. There might be a few bugs.
```
